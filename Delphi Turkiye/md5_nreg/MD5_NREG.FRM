Description: Delphi implementation of the MD5 message digest
             algorithm. MD5 provides a 128 bit cryptographically
             secure hash (Message Digest) of a given input.
             MD5 was one of the first generally accepted
             cryptographically secure hashes, and is still widely
             in use today.
             
             Features:
             
             - 160 bit hash length
             - Offers high-level functions for producing the hash
             of a string, file or stream
             - Full native Delphi source code included in
