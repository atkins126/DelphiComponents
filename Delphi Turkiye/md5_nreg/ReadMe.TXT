MD5.exe

This DOS version of the MD5 algorithm is a freeware version, and has been included here to allow you to check compatibility with the TSM version. We have used this extensively to ensure that the TSM MD5 is interoperable with other implementations.

You can supply a pathname as an argument to MD5.EXE and the file will be hashed.

If you do not supply a pathname, then the console is used as the default input. The input can be finished by using Control-Z.

Usage Examples:

MD5 c:\autoexec.bat
