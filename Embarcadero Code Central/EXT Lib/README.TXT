1. What is ExtLib?
=======================================================

Devrace ExtLib is intended for creation of specialized
applied and system applications. Using ExtLib you can
build into your programs:

- a visual form designer (the TELDesigner component
  together with TELDesignPanel) similar to the form
  designer in Borland Delphi;
- Object Inspector (the TELPropertyInspector component),
  similar to that in Borland Delphi;
- and even a visual diagram editor of databases, analogous
  to that in Ms Access (the TELDiagram and TELDBDiagram
  components).

The form designer enables you to create your own
applications, which are absolutely adjustable for their
users. That is they can easily change the form and
dialogue interface and reports. The form designer works
with groups of components and enables you to change the
component size and position on the form. The form
designer can be used in many various ways: to create
report generators, vector graphics editors, visual
constructors, specialized CASE-tools and even more.

The property editor (TELPropertyInspector) is one of
the components, which are mostly close in functionality
to a standard Object Inspector in Delphi/C++ Builder.
It enables you to change all properties of all standard
types, because it has built-in editors of such
properites. It also easily helps you to create your own
advanced property editors. TELPropertyInspector enables
you to show and edit properties of sets of objects. For
instance if one of your components (Panel1) refers to
another (PopupMenu1) by the PopupMenu property, so
TELPropertyInspector makes it possible to edit
PopupMenu1 properties as subproperties of the
Panel1.PopupMenu property. This implements the
functionality of Object Inspector in Delph 6.

Besides this the library has some additinal components
as: 

* TElTrayIcon intended for icon control in the system
  tray area (see also the examples TELTrayIcon and
  CDPlayer in \Demos subdirectory);
* TELEvent, TELEventSender for message exchange among
  components in the mode "one-to-many". This enables
  you to establish easier component interaction in
  complex projects (see the example TELEvent in \Demos);
* TELInstanceChecker used to forbid system starting of
  application recurring copies (see the examples
  CDPlayer and TELInstanceChecker in \Demos);
* TELStringList for use instead of TStringList in
  design-time;

And even more additional functions and classes for file
search in a separate thread, quick comparison of strings
with wildcards, quick sorting of arbitrary data type,
etc.

At the present ExtLib supports Borland Delphi 5-7.
ExtLib is a native component set and its evaluation
versions are distributed in the form of compiled units.
Registering ExtLib you get full sources of components
and technical support.
