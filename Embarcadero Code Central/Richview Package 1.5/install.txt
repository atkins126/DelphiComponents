If you have another version of RichView Package installed,
you need to delete (archive) it.
If older version remains in paths where Delphi
searches for components, you will not be able to compile/run
your applications with RichView properly.

INSTALLING COMPONENTS
  Components for Delphi 6 are in D6 directory.
  Open RVPkgD6.dpk (menu "File|Open") and click "Install" button 
in the package window. 
  If your version of Delphi supports database components, 
repeat the steps above with RVDBPkgD6.dpk.
