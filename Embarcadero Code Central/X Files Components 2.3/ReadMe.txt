  X-Files Components 2.3
  ======================

  X-Files Components 2.3  contains two powerful  components (TXDBGrid, TXQRGrid)
  designed for Delphi 3, 4, 5 & 6.

  This Special Edition  of X-Files Components contains files  for Delphi 6 only.
  You may download trial version of package for previous versions of Delphi from
  X-Files Components Website (http://kszyszka.republika.pl/).

  TXDBGrid is the functional extension of Borland's TDBGrid. TXDBGrid implements
  all standard TDBGrid's functions  and the many additional,  which are launched
  by including new Options or by setting values for new properties.  TXDBGrid is
  fully compatible with TDBGrid component on properties level and can be used as
  replacement without losing existing values. TXDBGrid has its own ColumnEditor,
  which can fully support all new column's properties.

  TXQRGrid is a complementary component for TXDBGrid designed for dynamic report
  creating on the grounds  of TXDBGrid current settings.  TXQRGrid can print and
  preview  content of TXDBGrid.  TXQRGrid create in run-time  complete report in
  QuickReport format. Report may be created in few parts (vertical bands) depend
  on selected paper size settings.

  Two versions  of X-Files Components are available:  Standard and Professional.
  The professional version can save created report to the files (XReportUnit.pas
  + XReportUnit.dfm) as QuickReport source code. Saved report can be modified by
  developer (or not) and added to Delphi project as the standalone report.

  If you take advantage Professional version of QuickReport, you should register
  "with Source" version of X-Files Components to recompile package.
