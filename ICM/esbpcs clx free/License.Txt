License Agreement

You should carefully read the following terms and conditions
before using this software.  Unless you have a different license
agreement signed by ESB Consultancy your use of this software 
indicates your acceptance of this license agreement and warranty.

This software is owned by ESB Consultancy and is protected by 
Australian Copyright Law and international copyright treaty. This 
License Agreement gives you use of the software not ownership of 
it.

Free Subset

The Free subset of ESBPCS can be freely distributed and used by
developers provided the copyright notices remain, ESB Consultancy
is given due credit and the contents are not sold to other developers.

The routines and components can be used in Commercial Projects.

Registered Version

One registered copy of ESBPCS may either be used by a single
developer who uses the software personally on one or more computers,
or installed on a single workstation used non-simultaneously by
multiple people, but not both. 

You may access the registered version of ESBPCS through a network,
provided that you have obtained individual licenses (or Site Licenses)
for the software covering all workstations that will access the 
software through the network.  For instance, if 8 different workstations
will access ESBPCS on the network, each workstation must have its
own ESBPCS license, regardless of whether they use ESBPCS at different 
times or concurrently.

5 Developer Licensing is available. 

Corporate and Site Licensing are available. Site Licensing covers any 
number of Developers working for a single Company within a 5 km radius. 
Corporate License covers any number of Developers for a Single Corporation.

You may not use ESBPCS in Delphi Libraries nor C++ Libraries that are 
sold to Developers without the express written permission of ESB 
Consultancy. Whilst Registered Users have Royalty Free rights to use 
ESBPCS in their Applications, this does not extend to the creation of 
DLLs, OCXs, BPLs or other form of Libraries that are aimed at Developers.

You may not distribute the ESBPCS source code in any form to anyone else. 
If your clients require full source code then they must purchase 
appropriate Developer Licenses. 

ESB Consultancy is always opened to negotiation when it comes to 
Licensing.
