Whilst the Trial version and the Commercial versions have installers,
this free subset does not - since it does have full source and is
free.

Purpose:
========

The Free subset is designed to give you a no-obligations taste for
what our commercial versions have. Basically you get the Math, Date/
Time & String Routines plus the ESBPCSEdit and Numeric Edits. 

The CLX version is currently under development - whereas the full 
VCL product has the following:

Making Data Entry and Manipulation Easier.

ESB Professional Computation Suite (ESBPCS) is a collection of over 
6000 routines/methods and over 150 classes/components in over 100 units
for Borland Delphi 4, 5, 6 & 7 and C++ Builder 4, 5 & 6, which are aimed at 
making "data entry and manipulation easier" for the Developer. 

Our components are designed to do more of the work for you and your 
users. 

Powerful Edit controls with Alignment, Read Only Colouring, On Focus 
Colouring, and a plethora of data specific properties and methods 
make using MaskEdit a thing of the past. Plus we supply a flexibility
that your users have always wished for from edit controls. We also 
supply special components for the editing & displaying of Fractions, 
Date/Time, Complex Numbers, Vectors & Matrices, SpinEdits, CalcEdits 
& ComboBoxes.

Also included are Attachable Labels, IP Address Edits, Hex Edit, 
Country Data stored in XML with ComboBox and Editor with full Source.

Let us do the Calculations for you.

Areas covered include Extended Currency Types, Date & Time 
Manipulation, Trigonometry,  Statistics, Linear Regression, 
Probability Distributions, Special Functions, Optimised Math, Vectors, 
Matrices, Equation Solving, Fractions, Business Math, Accounting, 
Complex Numbers, Geometry, Unit Conversions, Time Zones and much more.

There are also components to aid in Statistics, Unit Conversion, Math 
Label for displaying formulae and a Repeatable Speed Button that 
doesn't use a Timer.

Empowered Data Entry and Manipulation for your users.

Data Aware Versions - many of the components have Data Aware versions 
and we are working on more. These components allow formatting from 
the control rather than playing with Field Settings or Masks. Plus 
the Aligned Edits stay aligned during data entry which is one of the 
most asked for things from our users and no doubt yours as well.
NEW: Data Aware Labels & Data Aware Descriptive Statistics.

Delphi Math Unit is not required thus making the routines accessible 
to people with Standard Versions (which in many Countries do not 
include the Math Unit). 

Unfortunately, people with Delphi 5 and C++ Builder 5 Standard 
Versions cannot use the Data Aware Components but they can use 
everything else!

Requirements:
=============

This package was designed for use with Borland Delphi 4, 5, 6 & 7 or 
C++ Builder 4, 5 or 6 running on Microsoft Win32 platforms and has 
been tested on Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, 
Microsoft NT 4.0 SP4 (and above), Microsoft Windows 2000,
Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition and Microsoft Windows XP.

The Data Aware Components required Professional or higher Editions
of Delphi and C++ Builder.

b) When running Applications compiled with the Trial Version and the
D4/D5/D6/D7/BCB4/BCB5/BCB6 IDE is not running, you will get an "Error Msg".

c) No Source included with Trial Version.

d) Registered version bundles J. Peter Mugaas' JPM Open Components as
well as extra ESBPCS Design Time Package.

e) Enhanced Installer for re-building the Packages and installing 
them as well as the Help files comes with Registered version.

f) No Source to Utilities with Trial Version.
