<BASEFONT NAME="verdana" Size="2"><H2>Introduction</H2>ESBPCS for CLX is currently under development - so this is the current blurb for the VCL version. The CLX version will have similar (though not the same) features.<Br /><Br />ESB Professional Computation Suite (ESBPCS) is a collection of over 6000 routines/methods and over 150 classes/components in over 100 units for Borland Delphi 4, 5, 6 and 7 and Borland C++ Builder 4, 5 and 6, which are aimed at making "data entry and manipulation easier" for the Developer.<Br /><Br />Our components are designed to do more of the work for you and your users. Powerful Edit controls with Alignment, Read Only Colouring, Disabled Colouring, Optional Flat/"Hot" Look'n'feel, On Focus Colouring, and a plethora of data specific properties and methods make using MaskEdit a thing of the past. Plus we supply a flexibility that your users have always wished for from edit controls. We also supply special components for the editing and displaying of Fractions, Date/Time, Complex Numbers, Vectors and Matrices. Also includes Resource friendly Spin Edits, ComboBoxes, CalcEdits, Calendars, Calculators, Attachable Labels, IP Address Edits, Hex Edits, CheckBoxes, RadioGroups, CheckGroups and Button Edits.<Br /><Br /><B>Let us do the Calculations for you.</B><Br /><Br />Areas covered include Extended Currency Types, Date and Time Manipulation, Trigonometry, Statistics, Linear Regression, Probability Distributions, Special Functions, Optimised Math, Vectors, Matrices, Equation Solving, Fractions, Business Math, Accounting, Complex Numbers, Geometry, Unit Conversions and much more.<Br /><Br />There are also components to aid in Statistics, Unit Conversion, Maths Label for displaying formulae and a Repeatable Speed Button that doesn't use a Timer.<Br /><Br /><B>Empowered Data Entry and Manipulation for your users.</B><Br /><Br />Data Aware Versions - many of the components have Data Aware versions and we are working on more. These components allow formatting from the control rather than playing with Field Settings or Masks. Plus the Aligned Edits stay aligned during data entry which is one of the most asked for things from our users and no doubt yours as well. Includes Data Aware Labels, Data Aware Linear Regression and Data Aware Descriptive Statistics. <B>NOTE:</B> <I>Data Aware components and routines are not included in the "LITE" Version.</I><Br /><Br />Delphi Math Unit is not required thus making the routines accessible to people with Standard Versions (which in many Countries do not include the Math Unit). Unfortunately, people with Delphi 5 Standard (or BCB 5 Standard or Delphi 6 Personal or BCB 6 Personal) cannot use the Data Aware Components but they can use everything else and thus should consider the "LITE" Version.!<P><HR>
