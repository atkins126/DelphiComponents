Compatible with Delphi 6, 7, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010 and XE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


20th August 2010 - Release 6.20
Demos tested on Delphi 2010 and XE.  Note that Release 6.00 and later
for which no free version is available, the source must be licensed.

All the example application converted to support release 6.00 and later,
with the suffix 6, ie EXDIALC is now EXDIALC6.

Added missing EXNEWM and TAPIDEMO to the rasdemos project group.


10th August 2008 - Release 6.00

RASDEMO6
Support RAS WideChar APIs and Unicode for Delphi 2009 with new
MagRasxxxW units. Removed support for Win9x and NT4, both 10 years old now
The units may be compiled under Delphi 7 to 2007, but only support
Unicode properties under Delphi 2009 and later

TAPIDEMO6
Supports the Unicode Tapi functions.

The older example applications may be used with Release 6 by adding W to
the end of the users unit names, ie magrasconw instead of magrascon.

DEMOPW
Lists all RAS entries with the credentials, including passwords that the
normal RAS APIs suppress.

PSTEST
Demonstrates reading from the Protected Storage service, a protected part of
the registry used to store confidential information, specifically Outlook
Express credentials, but which may be used to save application passwords.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To assist developers getting started with the Magenta Systems Ltd
TMagRas Delphi component, a number of simple example programs are
provided.  Note that these programs only work with Release 4.4 and
later of the component.  TMagRas must be installed on the palette before
opening any project files.  The examples are very minimalist, but all
perfectly acceptable. If opened in Delphi 4 or 5 click to ignore
unsupported properties.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXMON6 - Monitor Example

Monitors for RAS connections started by other applications, and
allows hang-up.

Files: exmon6.dpr, exmon1.pas, exmon1.dfm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXDIALS6 - Dialling Simple Example

Dial, monitor and hang-up a RAS connection using information
already specified in the phonebook entry.

Files: exdials6.dpr, exdials1.pas, exdials1.dfm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXDIALC6 - Dialling Complex Example

Dial, monitor and hang-up a RAS connection, allowing the user to change
the telephone number and logon details, and dialling location.

Files: exdialc6.dpr, exdialc1.pas, exdialc1.dfm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXPERF6 - Performance Example

Shows the performance of RAS connections started by other applications,
and allows hang-up.

Files: experf6.dpr, experf1.pas, experf1.dfm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXNEW6 - New Entry Example

Create a new entry in the RAS phonebook (ie a new connection). It shows
the minimal options requited for a new entry, which will be created with
TCP/IP, PPP and dynamic IP addresses.

Files: exnew6.dpr, exnew1.pas, exnew1.dfm

------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXNEWM6 - New Entry Example (Modem)

Create a new entry in the RAS phonebook (ie a new connection). It shows
the minimal options requited for a new entry, which will be created with
TCP/IP, PPP and dynamic IP addresses. Takes the modem from the default
connection, ignores strange devices like VPN.

Files: exnew6.dpr, exnew1.pas, exnew1.dfm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXEDITS6 - Edit Entry Simple Example

Edit the properties of an entry in the RAS phonebook (ie a connection).
This simple version only shows the minimal options that are typically
edited by the user.

Files: exedits6.dpr, exedits1.pas, exedits1.dfm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXEDITC6 - Edit Entry Complex Example

Edit the properties of an entry in the RAS phonebook (ie a connection).
This complex version shows all the properties that can be edited.
The demo shows properties that are NT4 and/or Windows 2000 specific,
when ideally those edit boxes should be hidden if not supported.
Likewise several other options could be suppressed if not valid (like IP
addresses).

Files: exeditc6.dpr, exeditc1.pas, exeditc1.dfm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

RASDEMO6 - Full Demo Program

In addition to these example programs, there is a full demonstration
program that makes use of virtually all the functionality in the TMagRas
release 6 components, and is indeed the main test application used during
development.

The main difference from the examples above is that monitoring of
multiple calls and separate channels of multilink calls is supported.

Files: rasdemo6.dpr, demo6.pas, demo6.dfm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCUTTEST6 - Short Cut Testing


Allows a short cut to be created for a DUN connection entry on the
desktop.  Primarily a test program for magsubs2.pas.


Files: scuttest6.dpr, scutmain6.pas, scutmain6.dfm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

TESTMULTI6 - Test Multiple DUN Connection Entries

A test program to create and delete multiple DUN connection entries,
up to 999 at a time (but don't try that many).  This is primarily to
allow RAS applications to be tested with hundreds of test entries.

Files: testmulti6.dpr, testmmain6.pas, testmmain6.dfm
