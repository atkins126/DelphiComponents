  HISTORY:
  --------

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  * Version 1.00 (08/06/98) by Morgan Martinet (France)
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  * Version 1.01 (05/07/98) by Morgan Martinet (France)
    - Added a CRC check, suggested by Oliver Buschjost
    - Added default encryption with BlowFish, suggested by Oliver Buschjost
    - Added comparison between size of compressed and uncompressed block, suggested by Oliver Buschjost
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  * Version 1.02 (10/07/98) by Morgan Martinet (France)
    - Added storage of empty folders, suggested by Huanlin Tsai
    - Changed type of ArchiveSize to Comp, suggested by Oliver Buschjost
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  * Version 1.03 (16/07/98) by Morgan Martinet (France)
    - Fixed bug with empty folders
    - Fixed bug with deletion of files
    - Stored padding size of an encrypted block after the block itself instead of storing it
      in the BlockSize.
    - Gathered several boolean properties inside the property Options, suggested by Huanlin Tsai
    - Added oEraseFirstDisk
    - Added oCreateReadOnly, suggested by Oliver Buschjost
    - In WinArchiver, changed the config form
    - In WinArchiver, show the segment number in the Informations
    - In WinArchiver, add the possibility to change the BlockSize
    - Send an exception when we get a bad crc after decryption, telling the user
      that its password was certainly bad.
    - Allow encryption of files instead of the whole archive
    - Check key length
    - Ask confirmation of the key
    - Show message if the new inserted disk doesn't contain enough free space.
      And add an option to select this minimum.
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  * Version 1.04 (10/08/98) by Morgan Martinet (France)
    - Removed all the use of the VCL to reduce the size of the code.
      Now an application using only TExtractor (a self extracting archive
      for instance) will use about 100 Kb !
    - Removed 'Controls' from the uses clause of the Crypto units.
    - Created a form for entering the key, that don't show the key (****)
    - Added event OnGetSignature
    - Splitted the component TArchiver in several pieces:

       TArchiverRoot  (ArchiverRoot.pas)
            |_ TCustomExtractor   (CustExtractor.pas)
                    |_ TExtractor   (Extractor.pas)
                    |_ TCustomArchiver  (CustArchiver.pas)
                             |_ TArchiver   (Archiver.pas)

       The TCustomXXX components don't implement compression or encryption.
       But TExtractor and TArchiver implement a default compression (with the pasZLib)
       and a default encryption with the Blowfish algorithm.
       So, I suppressed the unit GZipArchiver, that should be replaced with Archiver.
    - Fixed a bug with the Filter property: it filtered only the files in the
      starting directory, and didn't walk in the sub-directories.
    - Fixed a bug in the DeleteFiles method.

    - Store archive size in the first segment when segmentation occurs,
      in order to avoid the swapping of the disks ! If you cancel the
      update of the first segment, then it will use the last segment or
      it will adjust itself after each segment.
    - One progress bar for the solid archives: the extraction of the archive
      is limited to 50%, then the enumeration is limited to 50% + 50%.
    - Fixed the problem with a renamed segment than could not be accepted.
  ------------------------------------------------------------

    - Added a "View" button to WinArchiver
    - Show icons for each file type.
    - Fixed bug with segmented solid archives.
    - Fixed bug with "Make SFX" and a solid archive : I delay the creation of SFX
      until the archive is closed. It means that when the solid archive is compressed
      in a new archive, this new archive is a SFX archive !
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  * Version 1.23 (19/10/98) by Morgan Martinet (France)
    - Fixed bug with "Make SFX" and a solid archive : instead of delaying, close
      the archive, compress it as SFX and reopen it.

    - Forced the optimization of code in the ArchiverMisc unit
      for the GetDiskSizeAvail function, that crashed without it.
    - In the AddDirectory method of TCustomArchiver, don't add
      file if the file is the archive itself !
      It's interesting if you want to store the archive in the
      directory that you're archiving.
    - Added event OnDeleteFileByIndex, useful when files are selected
      in a list.
    - Added event OnExtractFileByIndex, useful when files are selected
      in a list.
    - Renamed unit ZLib.pas to BZLib.pas to avoid a filename conflict with
      the ZLib.pas distributed by Inprise.
    - Added Danish language
    - Added Dutch language
    - Added Czech language
    - Added 2 messages to TArchiverRoot : CanNotCreateFile and CanNotOpenFile
      in order to catch the exceptions when creating or opening a file and
      translate it on the fly.
    - Added AssignTo method to TArchiverRoot, suggested by Hana Krizova
    - changed GetFreeSpace method, enlarged kMinDiskSpace constant because
      of system buffering, changed condition to test disk name to
      access network disks --> done by Hana Krizova
    - Added a new type for the file sizes : TFileSize = Integer
    - Added a list of filters to include/exclude files to be added in WinArchiver
    - protected methods (AddFile, AddDirectory, ExtractFiles...) if an operation is
      already in progress. If the option oShowBusyMessage is enabled, then the
      component will display a message before it exits.
    - Added option oShowBusyMessage : if you try to do an operation while an operation
      is already in progress, the component will display a warning message
      before it exits.
    - Added option oDoNotUpdateFirstSegment : lets you disable the action of requesting
      the first segment when the adding process of a multi-segmented archive
      finishes for updating the archive information that will be used when
      opening/extracting. In that case, the component will ask for the last
      disk instead of the first disk, but it is irritating when your archive
      has only 2 segments.
    - Renamed BackupTools.dpk to BackupTools_d3.dpk
    - Added BackupTools_d4.dpk for Delphi4
    - Fixed all warnings in Delphi4.
    - Extended Tutorial.txt
    - Added property AddMode to TCustomArchiver that lets you add and replace
      files in an archive, update them or freshen them.
    - Fixed a bug when extracting files with a network path,
      the destination was ExtractPath+FilePath instead of FilePath
      (thanks to Danjel Grosar).
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  * Version 1.32 (05/11/99) by Morgan Martinet (France)
    - Added external stream support through the property Stream of TArchiver.
      Now, you can set any stream to TArchiver (like a TMemoryStream or a TBlobStream)
      and read/write an archive.
    - Added Demo ExternalStream
    - Fixed a small bug in the GetDiskSizeAvail2 function, which was wrong
      which big partitions !
    - Added method OpenNew to TArchiverRoot. It lets you force the creation
      of a new archive, while opening an archive.
    - Added BackupTool_d5.dpk for a Delphi5 installation.
    - Fixed a bug in WinArchiver, thanks to Udo Joester (udo@joester.de):
      There was a division by zero when a folder contains only one file.
    - Forgot to implement the option oDoNotUpdateFirstSegment.
      Thanks to Mauro Favagrossa (mrfava@tin.it)
    - Added argument Filter to method GetDirectorySize, because
      EraseDrive used the method GetDirectorySize, and if a filter
      would not select any file, the return would be 0, and EraseDrive
      would not erase any file !!!
      Thanks to Mauro Favagrossa (mrfava@tin.it)
    - Added a check on the serial num disk when requesting a new disk,
      in order to avoid the deletion of the current segment.
      Thanks to Mauro Favagrossa (mrfava@tin.it)
    - Used TLargeInteger in function GetDiskFreeSpaceEx instead of Integer.
      Thanks to Mauro Favagrossa (mrfava@tin.it)
    - Some corrections in the italian strings.
      Thanks to Mauro Favagrossa (mrfava@tin.it)
    - Fixed a problem in the GetVersionInfo function of ArchiverMisc.pas 
      that didn't work properly with NT.
    - Introduced C++ Builder 3 and 4 compatibily
