History:                                                                               

Version 1.1.0 (2011-03-18)                                                             
Complete rewrite of the TNHunspell class to cover the fact that OXT containers         
often contain more than one dictionary (e.g. English UK, USA, Australian in one OXT).  
Support for older dictionaries (OpenOffice 2, uncompressed dictionary files) has       
been dropped.
