Getting Started
NetUpdater (TkmNetUpdate) is the fastest and easiest way to distribute all your software updates. Using a powerful client/server infrastructure, client software can be modified, patched, or completely updated in whatever configuration best suits your requirements. Flexible, secure, and reliable. Net Update is a simple, yet comprehensive software update solution built on trusted, industry-safe Internet and LAN protocols.

Installation
To install TkmNetUpdate into your IDE, take the following steps:

Unzip the release files into a new directory (e.g., d:\delphi\kidmoses\kmNetUpdate ).
Start Delphi.
Add the source subdirectory (e.g., d:\delphi\kidmoses\kmNetUpdate) to the IDE's library path. This is usually found under Tools - Environment Options - Libray.
Open & install the designtime package specific to the IDE being used. The IDE should notify you which components have been installed. It may be a good idea to compile the package before installing it to ensure it is compatible with your Delphi installation.
Make sure the PATH environmental variable contains the directory in which the compiled packages (i.e., BPL) were placed. Normally this is pre-set and does not need to be changed.
NetUpdater (TkmNetUpdate) can be installed into any directory. All the program settings are contained within the installation directory. No files are installed into any of the Windows system directories.

This is a source-only release of TkmNetUpdate. It includes designtime and runtime packages for Delphi 6, 7 and 2005. Sources are included so you should easily be able to port it over to Delphi 5 or 2006, if needed.

That's it! You're now ready to start creating application updates.
