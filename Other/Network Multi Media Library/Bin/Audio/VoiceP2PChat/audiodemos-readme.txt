All these demos where designed to be used with free Speex codec available at 
http://www.republika.pl/roed/speexw/download/speexw.exe which allows a decent 
sound quality at only about 10-20 kbits/sec connection, depending of the choosen 
quality. They can also work with PCM.

Most of other codecs available for the voice mode (8000-16000Hz) do not work 
with NMM yet. The future plans though is to make NMM working with Speex 
directly rather than push on other codecs.
