    It is with great delight that I announce some results of our
    quarterly cost cutting efforts. Over this past quarter, the customer
    service segment of our business has managed to reduce customer
    returns by over<it>50%</it>. This has netted our business<emph>
    incredible</emph>savings and shows great<emph>ingenuity</emph>on the
    part of our customer service staff. To quickly summarize two of the
    strategies involved, the various customer service groups decided to
    relocate the service desk at the<emph>back</emph>of each store
    instead of the front. The width of aisles in that section of the
    store was reduced, making it more difficult for customers to reach
    the service desk. The hiring of people unable to speak the English
    language also had a positive impact on the ability of the customer
    to return merchandise. A hearty congratulations and job well done to
    our teammates in customer service!</content>
