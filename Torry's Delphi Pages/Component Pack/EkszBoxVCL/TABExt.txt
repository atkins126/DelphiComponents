TABExtProgressBar
Version 1.1

Copyright © 2001-2002 Aaron Bockover.
Portions Copyright © 2000 Harold Howe and bcbdev.com.

TABExtProgressBar is to be governed under the same terms and conditions
set for TxGauge by Harold Howe. To review these terms, please read the
hhreadme.txt file located in the same directory as this file.

INSTALLATION:
Under BCB6, you can simply install using the provided package.
If you are running BCB5 or lower, you will need to create your own
package for TABExtProgressBar. TABExtProgressBar has been tested under
BCB5 and 6.

OVERVIEW:
TABExtProgressBar is an extension of Harold Howe's TxGauge control. 
Harold's original control was designed as an alternative to the VCL's 
TCGauge control, which did not allow you to choose the inverted ForeColor 
(see hhreadme.txt).

TxGauge was extended by Aaron Bockover for private use in Wav2Mp3 
(www.aaronbock.net). The only change was that it supported 64 bit integers, 
something Wav2Mp3 required.

Over a year later, TxGauge was further extended by Aaron Bockover into
TABExtProgressBar, which is the current control. 

A number of new properties were added by Aaron to TABExtProgressBar:

 - AlignText
 - FillStyle
 - InnerBorderSize
 - PercentAt
 - SingleBorderColor
 - Step
 - Text

Also, two simple step methods (as well as the step property) were added to 
provide easier migration from the Windows TProgressBar control:

 - StepIt(void);
 - StepBy(int);

Finally, a new Border type is available, gbFatRaised, which is gbDeepSunken,
except inverted.

There are a few things to note:

I still have a few things to work out with the FillStyle gsDashed. It will 
look much better if you set InnerBorderSize to 1.

I am hoping to add much more functionality to this control in the future.

Lastly, I would just like to thank Harold for doing such a wonderful 
job on TxGauge!
