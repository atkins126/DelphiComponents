TxGauqe is Copyright (C) 2000 by Harold Howe and bcbdev.com.

TxGauge is a flexible, horizontal, analog gauge. It allows you to choose from
a variety of color cominations, fonts, and border styles. Unlike the VCL TCGauge
control, TxGauge allows you to choose the inverted font color (the color of the
percent label after the percent reaches 50 %). The VCL gauge automatically
inverts the ForeColor, so that blue becomes yellow, black becomes white, etc.
My gauge controls contains a separate property called BackFontColor that
determines the background font color. My control does not assume that you want
to automatically invert the ForeColor.
