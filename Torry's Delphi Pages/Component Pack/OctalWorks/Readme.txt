Send any remarks to : info@octalworks.com
Please clearly state which Delphi or C++Builder version you are using
and which version of the component you are using. In case of doubt,
download the latest version first at http://www.octalworks.com
When installing newer versions of the component, make sure to update
all your form files that used the previous version of TAdvAlertWindow
before recompiling your application to make sure all new properties
are available. You can update the form file by opening it, ignoring
remarks about new properties and save the form.
