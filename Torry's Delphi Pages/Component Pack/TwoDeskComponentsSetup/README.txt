Installation:

To install this component package, simply run the TwoDeskComponentsSetup program.
For most people, the setup program will fully configure itself for use with your
version of Delphi.

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS AFTER INSTALLATION:

For a few people, the precompiled editions of these components may not be
compatible with your system.  This can happen if you have recompiled parts of
the VCL or have replaced some default VCL packages with customized packages
created by yourself or others, or if you have not installed certain parts of
the VCL.

If this happens, you will need to recompile the components.  In the installation
directory you will find the appropriate .dpk files for your version of Delphi. You
will need to locate both the _R and _D files.  Open these files in Delphi.  Build
the _R file first, followed by the _D file.  You will need to move the generated
.bpl file to the system directory, which is usually C:\Windows\System32.  Once
this is done, install the _D file.  In Delphi 5-7, this is done by clicking the
"Install" button on the package window.  In Delphi 2005, right-click on the
project manager and click "Install" in the context menu that appears.  You will
then be able to use the components.
