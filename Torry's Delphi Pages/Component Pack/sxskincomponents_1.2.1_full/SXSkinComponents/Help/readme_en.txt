Services: GUI development with use of SXSkinComponents
======================================================

SXSkinComponents is a very powerful pack of visual components, which allows
to develop graphical user interfaces of applications with any complexity
and high quality. These components are most suitable for small
applications, in which developer wants to focus user's attention on the
main window with use of graphical effects and animations.

It is clean, that SXSkinComponents are difficult to use because they have
lots of features. Thus we (the author of the components and a group of
programmers, who are familiar with SXSkinComponents) decided to provide to
developers a new service. We can create skin-files and write neccessary
Delphi/C++Builder code to make SXSkinComponents work properly in your
application. I want to focus your attention on the fact, that we are not
graphical designers, thus the main concepts of GUI must be provided by you.

Think about over offer. You will spend some weeks to understand lots of
features of SXSkinComponents, then you will spend one more week to fix
bugs in skin-files. At the same time, we can do this work only in some
days. Appreciate your time.

The cost of this service depends on how long does it take to develop the
GUI. If you give us all images, which are included into skin-file, our
help will cost you only about $50. If you need more detailed help in
development, head for about $200.

Here you can see the order of our cooperation:
1. You contact us (e-mail address is given below) and briefly describe,
   what type of GUI you are going to develop. It is great, if you have a
   template of your GUI, which is drawn in Photoshop or other graphical
   editor (send it as an attachment).
2. If we have any vacant developers, we provide you information about
   price and approximate GUI development deadline.
3. If you want to use SXSkinComponents in a commercial project, you have
   to buy a license ($10 or $50, see above). Otherwise you should pay 20%
   of the cost (this is neccessary to confirm your paying capacity).
4. When the main part of the development process is finished, we send you
   a demo-application, in which the developed skin-file is used.
5. You pay 50% (30%) of the cost, tell us, what we need to upgrade or
   modify in GUI.
6. We finish the GUI development process, then send you the final version
   of the program.
7. You pay the last 50% of the cost.
8. We send you program sources, images and skin-files.
9. During the specified term we support your GUI (upgrade or modify
   skin-files).
