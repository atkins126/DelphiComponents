XPLorer 1.1

The Delphi Package "XPLorer" contains five components you can use to adapt the design of your applications to the Windows XP-Themes:

- TXPInformationPanel and TXPInformationBar make it possible to imitate the info-panels used in the Windows Explorer. You can also use them to create a tidy interface for your self-made programs.
- TXPStyler adapts the look and feel of many standard VCL-components to Windows XP (will work on computers with Windows XP only).
- With TXPInformationDialog, you can create a information dialogue, similar to the one used in many Windows XP applications.
- TXPBubbleHint can be used to display any information in bubble-hints known from Windows XP. Unlike most similar components, this one will also work on systems using older versions of Windows.

You can use these components without restrictions, the developers are not responsible for the way you use the components.
You may only pass on these files in complete extent and together with this information.
If you want to make major changes on one or more of these components, you have to ask us for permission (you can write an e-mail to "freeze.dev@web.de").
The regulations laid down in the "Impressum" at "www.freeze.dev.de.vu" are also valid for this package.
With using this component package, you declare that you read, understood and acknowledged this regulation and the regulations of the "impressum" at "www.freeze.dev.de.vu".
