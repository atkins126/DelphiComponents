QUESTION:

 I dropped a TOraDB and a TAOraSQL components onto a form. I set the properties,
 and TAOraSQL.SQL property to 'select * from real_actl'.
 This table has many fields and it has a field, name TBLA.
 So I tried to open the dataset. Than I got a message: 'Field 'TBLA' not found!'. 
 I missed something?

ANSWER:

 If you use TAOraSQL for SQL queries your can define all fields manually. 
 If your table has two fields: TBLA(integer) and TBBB(string) your can do next:

  AOraSQL.SetSQL('select * from real_actl');
  AOraSQL.AddField('TBLA',ftoInteger,0,True);
  AOraSQL.AddField('TBBB',ftoString,50,True);
  AOraSQL.Open;

 The other way to call LoadFields method before Open.

  AOraSQL.SetSQL('select * from real_actl');
  AOraSQL.LoadFields;
  AOraSQL.Open;

 If you use TOraSQL no any additional actions needed:

  OraSQL.SQL.Text:='select * from real_actl';
  OraSQL.Open;

QUESTION:
 I am trying to install DOCI components on Delphi5, but I receive error message that file
 DsgnIntf.dcu not found.

ANSWER:
 Borland forgot to add DsgnIntf.dcu installation packet, but you can find DsgnIntf.pas
 in $(DELPHI)/Sources/ToolsApi folder. You should add this path to the Library Path section 
 of your IDE (menu Tools/Environment Options/Library tab/Library Path editbox).
 After adding path DOCI components should be compiled withoput errors.
