1. Welcome
----------------------------------------------------
Degisy Data is a package of VCL-components for processing Clarion, dBase,
Paradox and Degisy tables. Thanks to the direct access technology, this
software solution processes tables very fast, almost instantly, making it
a perfect solution for creating applications where a high data processing
speed is a basic requirement. All components are inherited from the
original TDataSet class, which guarantees their full compatibility with
all standard DB Controls. 100% native Delphi code - no additional libraries
or programs needed for the components to work. BDE, ADO etc also not
required. The components can be used in Delphi 5,6,7 and C++ Builder 6.
