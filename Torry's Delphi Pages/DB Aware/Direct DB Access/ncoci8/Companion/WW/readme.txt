------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains TwwOCIQuery and TwwOCIStoredProc  
components source file. I have tested it only with 
InfoPower 4. I found, that FilterDlg works well in any
modes. Other controls works also, excluding that, what
is index oriented.

Demo maded by Alexander Okorokov (oan42@yahoo.com), also
his comment: 

Demo in dir WWNCOCI8 works without TwwOCIQuery.
InfoPower 3000 Help for TwwQuery:
InfoPower 2000/3000 allows you to use TQuery instead of TwwQuery,   
but this component is provided for backward compatibility.  
The TwwQuery additionally will allow you to filter on lookupfields.
