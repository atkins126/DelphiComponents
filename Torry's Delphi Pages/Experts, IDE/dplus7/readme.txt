DesignerPlus is an freeware expert for Delphi IDE. It allows 
you to work with controls on forms, that is to change 
positions, size, TabOrder properties and some other things. 
DesignerPlus makes you feel more comfortable during work in 
Delphi IDE. In most cases it gives you an opportunity to work 
only with a help of hot keys without using a mouse.
